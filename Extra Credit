    Each row in the first table will be tied to a particular precinct name
        The columns will be:
    
         registered voters
      
         number of total ballots
      
         Percentage of the total vote
         
         The number of voters who voted in person
         
         Primary Key: precinct name
         Foreign Key: registered voters
      
    Each row in the first table will be tied to a particular precinct name
        
        The columns will be:
        
         Shape area of the precinct
            
         Shape Length of the precinct
         
         Number of voters in the precinct
         
         Primary Key: precinct name
         Foreign Key: shape area
            
    I think the tables should be organized this way because the shape area and lenghth of the precinct are similar types of inforamtion
    The data in the first table all pertains directly to voter turnout
