    Each row in the first table will be a different zip code

        The columns will be:
    
         Number of people
      
         Number of people who identify as female
      
         Number of people who identify as male
      
    Each row in the second table will be a different zip code
        
        The columns will be:
        
         Number of people
            
         Count of people in each ethnographic group
            
    Iâ€™m organizing the tables this way because sex and ethnic group are different types of demographic information, so it may make more sense to put them into separate tables.
